# mpv-sub_not_forced
This is a LUA script for MPV that automatically prevents the selection of forced subtitles at the start.

## Installation
To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Locate the script directory for your operating system:

| **OS** | **Location** || --- | --- |
| GNU/Linux or macOS | **`~/.config/mpv/scripts/`** |
| Windows | **`C:/Users/Username/AppData/Roaming/mpv/scripts/`** |

2. Download the `mpv-sub_not_forced.lua` file from this repository.

3. Place the downloaded file in the script directory mentioned in step 1.

4. Restart MPV or reload the scripts by pressing Shift + R while the player is running.

## Usage
Once the script is installed, it will automatically prevent the selection of forced subtitles when you start playing a video with MPV. Forced subtitles are subtitles that are displayed only for sections of the video that contain non-dialogue elements such as signs, captions, or foreign language translations.

With this script, you no longer have to manually disable forced subtitles every time you start playing a video.
